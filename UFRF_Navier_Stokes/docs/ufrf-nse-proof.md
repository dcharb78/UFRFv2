## Abstract
This document outlines how the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (NSE) emerge as observer-relative projections of concurrent E×B vortex rotations in the Universal Field Resonance Framework (UFRF). We map NSE terms to UFRF components, describe a reproducible pseudo-spectral solver, and provide a UFRF-inspired 13-wedge angular filter to probe predicted coherence. See consolidated references in the UFRFv2 repo [`UFRFv2`](https://github.com/dcharb78/UFRFv2).

## Core Mapping (from StartSummary)
- Velocity field u arises from averaged E×B rotations across the 13-position cycle.
- Nonlinearity (u·∇)u corresponds to interference at half-integers among concurrent log spaces.
- Pressure gradient is the projection of E–B imbalance.
- Diffusion term ν∇²u corresponds to dissipation at REST (position 10), with intrinsic ν* related to η/s ~ (1/(4π))√φ.
- Incompressibility follows from trinity preservation (sum to zero).

### UFRF Terminology Translation (for readers)
- Trinity {-0.5, 0, +0.5} → base concurrent rotations generating E (axis), B/B′ (planes).
- 13-position cycle → discrete evolutionary positions; REST (10) is E=B balance with √φ enhancement.
- Projection law → ln O = ln O* + d_M·α·S + ε; measurement shifts intrinsic O*.
- Wedge sectors → angular spectral projectors P_i aligned with 13 centers (±halfwidth), optional half-offset adds 13 interleaves.
- REST damping → geometrically justified dissipation operator D_rest acting only through wedge projections.

## Runnable Context
Use `ufrf_ns_min.py` to run a minimal 2D NSE comparison: standard vs UFRF filter.

### Run
```bash
python ufrf_ns_min.py --n 128 --steps 800 --dt 5e-3 --nu 1e-3 --seed 1717 --halfwidth-deg 6 --include-half
```

### Notes
- Determinism is enforced via fixed RNG seed and stable spectral paths.
- The 13-wedge mask follows centers spaced by 360/13°, optional half-offset adds 26 total centers.

### 3D Extensions
- Implemented 3D Taylor–Green decay with energy budget; steady decay observed with ε consistent with dE/dt.
- 3D forced box: Kolmogorov vs UFRF shell forcing at low Re show comparable steady-state energies; UFRF shell aligns forcing to shells consistent with wedge projection logic.

### Boundary Flows (2D)
- Lid-driven cavity (no-slip box) and channel (Poiseuille) added for boundary-condition breadth. The cavity uses vorticity–streamfunction with Thom boundary vorticity; the channel includes a body-force proxy for dp/dx with parabolic fit. These provide qualitative checks that UFRF stabilization and diagnostics extend beyond periodic domains.
## Scope & Limitations
- This is a UFRF-aligned computational evidence suite, not a formal existence/smoothness proof.
- Stabilization uses REST projection operators and high‑k damping; we provide ablations (wedge-only, friction-only) to demonstrate robustness.
- Periodic domains are the default; boundary-driven flows (cavity/channel) are future work.
- 3D runs are at modest resolutions in this artifact; higher‑N TG and forced DNS are future extensions.
### Energy Budget (Forced Runs)
We log: energy E(t), dissipation ε(t)=2ν⟨|∇u|²⟩, dE/dt, and power input P_in(t). In steady state, the balance dE/dt ≈ P_in − ε holds; we report the residual in CSV. This addresses conservation expectations and quantifies stabilization vs input.

## REST Projection Operator (Formalism)
Let the 13-position cycle define orthonormal angular sectors S_i on the spectral circle (centers at 360/13°, optional half-offset). Define projection operators P_i mapping any spectral field X̂(k) onto sector i with a smooth window w_i(k):

- P_i X̂(k) = w_i(k) X̂(k), with Σ_i w_i(k) ≈ 1 for covered k.

REST corresponds to position i=10 (E=B balance). We define a REST-damping operator D_rest acting on vorticity ω via its spectrum:

- D_rest[ω̂](k) = -γ_rest(k) P_rest(k) ω̂(k), where γ_rest(k) ≥ 0.

Intuition: At REST, the E×B rotation is balanced; projection dissipates excess rotational energy without violating incompressibility. In code, γ_rest is realized as a small linear friction γ and optional high‑k spectral damping honoring REST gates. This embeds stabilization in UFRF geometry instead of ad hoc numerics, preserving the trinity balance and wedge alignment.

## Appendix: Incompressibility and Wedge Commutation
1) Incompressibility preservation under REST damping:
   - In vorticity–streamfunction form, ∇·u=0 is enforced by u = ∇⊥ψ. The REST operator acts on ω̂(k) multiplicatively: ω̂_t = ω̂ + Δt·(… − γ_rest P_rest ω̂).
   - Since ψ̂ = −ω̂/|k|² and û = i k⊥ ψ̂, any multiplicative operation on ω̂ yields ψ̂ scaled by the same factor; u remains rotational (k·û=0). Therefore ∇·u stays zero for all time.
2) Wedge projection commutes with vorticity–streamfunction mapping:
   - Let P be any angular projector (wedge). Then P ψ̂ = −P(ω̂/|k|²) = −(P ω̂)/|k|² by linearity; likewise û = i k⊥ ψ̂ implies P û = i k⊥ (P ψ̂). Thus applying P before or after the ψ, u reconstruction yields the same result. Hence wedge operations are consistent with the formulation and do not introduce spurious divergence.
