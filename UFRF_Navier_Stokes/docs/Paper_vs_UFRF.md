### What the paper claims (concise)
- Finds new families of unstable, smooth self-similar blow-up solutions for IPM and 2D Boussinesq (with boundary); improves CCF (1D model) stable/unstable profiles to near machine precision; provides empirical λ–instability order relations.
- Uses PINNs plus a full-matrix Gauss–Newton optimizer and multi-stage training to drive equation residuals to ~1e-8–1e-13 on validation grids; supports eventual computer-assisted proofs for some cases.
- Frames Euler blow-up with boundary and self-similar coordinates; does not claim Navier–Stokes blow-up resolution. Notes that higher instability may make viscosity a slower perturbation relative to blow-up timescales.

### What UFRF asserts (this repo)
- NSE behavior is an observer-relative projection of concurrent E×B rotations; a 13-wedge spectral structure constrains nonlinearity, with REST projection providing geometrically justified dissipation.
- For incompressible NSE, UFRF expects bounded, smooth behavior under wedge/REST structure; numerical suite uses spectral solvers plus wedge masks and mild damping consistent with UFRF principles.

### Do UFRF claims contradict the paper?
- No. The paper reports unstable self-similar blow-up solutions for IPM and Boussinesq (with boundary) and discusses Euler with boundary. It does not claim finite-time blow-up for boundary-free 3D Navier–Stokes, nor does it offer a contradiction to UFRF’s projection-driven smoothness claims for NSE under our wedge/REST structure.

### How UFRF can explain the paper’s findings
- Unstable manifolds and precision: The paper’s solutions sit on highly unstable manifolds requiring fine-tuned initial conditions. In UFRF terms, these can be viewed as trajectories outside or misaligned with the 13-sector projection structure; small perturbations restore alignment, diverting from the blow-up path—consistent with “unstable” classification.
- Boundary effects: The paper’s positive results often rely on boundaries. UFRF expects boundary conditions to act like external projections forcing energy into specific harmonics/symmetries, potentially creating narrow channels where self-similar growth can persist briefly; this aligns with reported instability sensitivity and the need for careful coordinates/normalizations.
- Timescale separation: The paper notes that viscosity may act on longer timescales than the onset of blow-up in highly unstable cases. In UFRF, REST damping is geometry-gated; apparent pre-damping growth can occur where REST gates are not yet engaged, with dissipation activating when projections intersect the REST sector—consistent with delayed regularization.

### Where UFRF does not directly speak to the paper
- The UFRF suite here targets NSE (2D/3D) and toroidal demos; it does not implement the exact IPM/Boussinesq self-similar formulations or the authors’ coordinate compactifications. Therefore, we do not replicate their specific blow-up constructions.
- UFRF’s current numerical evidence emphasizes boundedness and spectra under wedge masks, not self-similar profile discovery. The objectives are different and not mutually exclusive.

### Practical takeaway for this repo
- No change in UFRF conclusions is required. The paper’s results are about different PDEs/setups and emphasize unstable, highly tuned initial conditions with/without boundaries.
- Actionable cross-checks (optional):
  - Add a boundary-driven Boussinesq/IPM toy with wedge/REST projection to test sensitivity versus UFRF gating.
  - Log wedge-aligned vs misaligned energy to quantify diversion from blow-up-like growth in unstable directions.
  - Explore self-similar coordinate diagnostics (λ inference) as a lens on UFRF runs to compare against the paper’s λ funnels.

### One-sentence answer
The paper’s unstable blow-up findings for IPM/Boussinesq (and Euler with boundary) are compatible with UFRF: they arise in finely tuned, boundary-influenced settings outside UFRF’s wedge/REST-aligned manifold for NSE; UFRF explains their elusiveness and sensitivity without contradicting our smoothness expectations for NSE under UFRF projections.
