# CALL_FOR_DATA.md — Invitation to Collaborate

We invite experimental groups working on graphene/2D Dirac materials to test the M-scaling predictions:

- Provide one Measurements CSV and (optionally) one Ratios CSV using `docs/DATA_SCHEMA.md`.
- We will return an analysis pack with α estimates (CIs), O_* convergence across techniques, and invariance diagnostics.
- Licensing: CC BY-NC 4.0; please cite “UFRF–Graphene (Coupling-First Package)”.
