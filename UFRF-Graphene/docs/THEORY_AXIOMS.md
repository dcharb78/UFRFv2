# THEORY & AXIOMS (Graphene-Focused)

## 1. 13-Cycle & REST
- The 13-position cycle has a balance point at **6.5/13 ↔ Re(s)=1/2** (critical symmetry).
- **REST (D₁₀)**: the “intrinsic” anchor where coupling α→0 recovers invariant values.

## 2. Fibonacci Hubs & Ratio Invariance
- Fibonacci primes act as cross-space hubs; **adjacent Fibonacci ratios** in spectra (8:5, 13:8, …) are predicted to be **α-robust** (scale cancels).

## 3. M-Scaling (Observer–System Coupling)
- Effective scale: \(M_\mathrm{eff} = M_0 (M_1/M_0)^\alpha\), \(\alpha\in[0,1]\).
- Observables scale as \( O_{meas} = O_* (M_1/M_0)^{d_M\alpha} \times \text{(disorder)} \).
- \(d_M\) depends on the observable (for η/s, start with \(+1\)).

## 4. Predictions for Graphene/2D Dirac
- **η/s (REST):** \((1/4\pi)\sqrt{\varphi} \approx 0.101\).
- **Factor-of-4:** decomposes into **M-shift × disorder × 2D projection** (no contradiction between techniques).
- **28 K feature:** potential resonance-linked signature in clean devices near 28 K.

## 5. Falsifiable Criteria
- Different techniques yield different slopes in \(\log O\) vs surrogate **S**.
- After α-correction and offset removal, **O\_*** across techniques converges.
- Fibonacci ratios remain invariant vs **S** within uncertainty.
