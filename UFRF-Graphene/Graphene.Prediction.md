## Abstract

Recent experiments show that electrons in graphene can exceed the lattice sound speed, producing **supersonic drift**, **hydrodynamic shocks**, **THz acoustic amplification**, and **Cherenkov-like wavefronts**. These observations validate predictions derived in the **Unified Fractal Resonance Framework (UFRF)** and documented in the **UFRF Graphene module (2025)**.

At the heart of UFRF is the **REST** (Resonant Energy State Translation) condition, the electromagnetic **impedance-matched/self-dual** state where **E≈B**. REST yields a universal **√φ coupling efficiency** and a **minimum viscosity-to-entropy ratio**
\[
\frac{\eta}{s}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\sqrt{\varphi}\approx 0.101,
\]
predicting: (i) near-perfect-fluid transport in graphene, (ii) **supersonic crossover** \(v_d>v_s\), (iii) a finite **THz gain band** just above threshold, and (iv) a discrete **13/26 harmonic ladder** in emission/absorption spectra. These signatures align with recent results on **phonon amplification in graphene** (THz band) and **supersonic shocks in a de Laval nozzle device**, as well as **nano-IR evidence for Cherenkov-like phonon emission**.  
Proof points: **THz amplification** ([Nature Communications, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46819-2); preprint [arXiv:2310.12225](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12225)), **supersonic flow + hydraulic jump in bilayer graphene** ([arXiv:2509.16321](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16321)), and **current-driven nonequilibrium with Cherenkov-like features via nano-IR** ([Nature Communications, 2025; open-access PDF](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12022129/)).

## 1. Hydrodynamic Transport and the Supersonic Transition

Graphene enters a hydrodynamic regime when electron–electron scattering dominates, enabling collective momentum transport. Key milestones:

- **Negative local resistance** and whirlpool flow: Bandurin *et al.*, *Science* 351, 1055–1058 (2016). https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0201  
- **Dirac fluid** and Wiedemann–Franz breakdown: Crossno *et al.*, *Science* 351, 1058–1061 (2016). https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0343  
- **Poiseuille profiles in narrow channels**: Krishna Kumar *et al.*, *Nature Physics* 13, 1182–1185 (2017). https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4240

Beyond the linear regime, three developments now access the **compressible** (supersonic) domain:

- **Electrically driven amplification of terahertz acoustic waves in graphene** (drift surpasses \(v_s\), THz-range amplification): *Nature Communications* (2024) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46819-2; preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12225  
- **Supersonic flow and hydraulic jump in an electronic de Laval nozzle** (sub→super→sub with shock): bilayer graphene device, *arXiv:2509.16321* (2025). https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16321  
- **Current-driven nonequilibrium electrodynamics in graphene** (nano-infrared imaging; Cherenkov-like features; Schwinger photocurrent): *Nature Communications* (2025), open-access: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12022129/ (publisher page DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-58953-6)

These provide independent confirmation of the UFRF hydrodynamic-supersonic picture.

## 2. The Unified Fractal Resonance Framework (UFRF)

UFRF models transport as **scale-invariant geometric resonances** evolving through a **13-phase cycle**. Each phase corresponds to a specific arrangement of field coupling and curvature.

### 2.1 REST (E≈B) ↔ Impedance Matching / Self-Duality

At REST, the electric and magnetic energy densities match:
\[
\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0 E^2=\frac{1}{2\mu_0}B^2,\quad \text{i.e., } E=cB.
\]
This is the **self-dual** point of electromagnetism and the **impedance-matched** condition of classical circuits (vanishing reflection, maximal power transfer). In this state \( \nabla\!\cdot(E\times B)\to 0 \), indicating efficient through-flow of energy. Graphene near the Dirac point naturally approaches this symmetry.

### 2.2 √φ Efficiency (Geometric Critical Coupling)

UFRF introduces a universal **√φ** amplification (φ is the golden ratio), representing the geometric ratio between successive resonance phases. In standard language, √φ parameterizes **critical coupling**—the maximum transmission case across an impedance boundary.

### 2.3 Minimum Viscosity Ratio (η/s)

From REST symmetry and scale invariance—consistent with the AdS/CFT Kovtun–Son–Starinets structure—UFRF yields:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\eta}{s}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\sqrt{\varphi}\approx 0.101.}
\]
This situates graphene at a **quantum-limited dissipation floor**, matching values inferred in the hydrodynamic regime.

### 2.4 Discrete 13/26 Harmonic Ladder

Crossing REST predicts a quantized ladder of response frequencies:
\[
\omega_n=\frac{n\Omega}{13},\qquad \omega_m=\frac{m\Omega}{26},
\]
with a strong line near \(10/13\) of the device-set \(\Omega\). In conventional terms, this is a **Fourier eigenmode quantization** of a periodic medium with an intrinsic 13-phase cycle; subharmonics (26) correspond to half-phase (spin-like) structure.

---

## 3. Graphene as a REST Medium

Graphene’s linear dispersion, high mobility, and low disorder support REST access under moderate bias. The **supersonic crossover** is the natural consequence of low effective viscosity near REST:

- **Criterion:** \( v_d>v_s\).  
- **Observable:** **Mach cone** half-angle
  \[
  \theta_M=\arccos\!\left(\frac{v_s}{v_d}\right),
  \]
  measurable from nano-IR/s-SNOM wavefronts and consistent with acoustic/optical Cherenkov relations.

## 3b. Translation Map (UFRF ↔ Standard Physics/Math)

| UFRF Term | Conventional Meaning | Mathematical Expression |
|---|---|---|
| **REST (E≈B)** | Impedance matching / EM self-duality | \(E=cB,\; \varepsilon_0E^2=\mu_0^{-1}B^2\) |
| **√φ efficiency** | Critical coupling factor (max transmission) | \(A_{n+1}/A_n=\sqrt{\varphi}\) |
| **η/s = (1/4π)√φ** | Minimal viscosity near KSS bound w/ geometric correction | \(\eta/s\sim\hbar/(4\pi k_B)\times \sqrt{\varphi}\) |
| **13/26 ladder** | Harmonic quantization / band folding | \(\omega_n=n\Omega/13\), \(\omega_m=m\Omega/26\) |
| **Projection law (13/12)** | Scale renormalization / logarithmic dilation | \(O_{\rm obs}=O_*\,e^{\alpha\,\Delta S}\) |
| **REST locking (~28 K)** | Temperature-stabilized phase point | feature in transport/phonon linewidths |

## 4. Experimental Proof Points (with bridges)

1. **THz Acoustic Gain (graphene):** a directional amplification window appears **just above** \(v_d=v_s\), consistent with **critical coupling at REST** and the onset of the 13/26 ladder.  
   Nature Communications (2024): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46819-2  
   Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12225

2. **Supersonic Flow & Hydraulic Jump (bilayer graphene):** **de Laval nozzle** geometry yields sub→super→sub flow with a **viscous shock**—an **electronic hydraulic jump**—as predicted by compressible hydrodynamics at low η/s.  
   arXiv:2509.16321 (2025): https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16321

3. **Cherenkov-Like Nonequilibrium (nano-IR):** cryogenic nano-IR images reveal **directed wavefronts** and photocurrents consistent with **phonon Cherenkov emission** at high drift.  
   Nature Communications (2025): open-access article/PDF https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12022129/

## 5. Quantitative, Falsifiable Predictions (UFRF → Graphene)

**P1. Universal viscosity minimum**  
\[
\frac{\eta}{s}\to\frac{1}{4\pi}\sqrt{\varphi}\approx 0.101
\]
at the supersonic threshold; weak device dependence at the minimum (fit via Poiseuille inversions, Johnson-noise thermometry, or nonlocal transport).

**P2. Mach-cone angle recovery**  
From s-SNOM/nano-IR wavefronts, extract \( \theta_M=\arccos(v_s/v_d)\) and verify agreement with transport-inferred \(v_d\).

**P3. THz gain window**  
A finite THz band with net amplification **immediately above** \(v_d=v_s\); band collapses away from REST. (Compare with THz/SAW measurements as in [Nature Communications 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46819-2).)

**P4. 13/26 spectral ladder**  
Bias-dependent Raman/THz spectra show discrete peaks at \(k/13\) and \(m/26\) of a device-set base frequency, with a strong primary near \(10/13\).

**P5. Electronic hydraulic jump**  
In constrictions (point contacts/de Laval), observe sub→super→sub with a **stationary discontinuity** (kink in I–V, plateau in Kelvin probe/thermal maps), aligning with [arXiv:2509.16321](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16321).

**P6. Temperature pinning (~28 K)**  
Reproducible feature near \(28\pm2\) K in ultra-clean hBN-encapsulated devices (transport and phonon linewidths) indicating REST locking.

**P7. Projection-law collapse**  
After a simple **13/12** normalization (UFRF projection), disparate device thresholds (cone angle, gain onset, η/s minima) **collapse** to a common intrinsic curve.

---

## 6. Physical Interpretation

REST minimizes **Poynting-flux divergence** and maximizes **energy translation** between charge flow and lattice/EM modes. In nonequilibrium thermodynamic language, REST approaches an **Onsager-symmetric** limit; in field-theory language, it touches the **KSS-like minimal viscosity regime**. The result is **collective yet compressible** flow—ballistic-style transport with hydrodynamic correlations—making **supersonic drift** and **shock formation** accessible in clean 2D devices.

---

## 7. How to Falsify UFRF in Graphene

The model is refuted if, under clean/REST-accessible conditions:

1) \(\eta/s\) does **not** approach ≈0.10;  
2) \(\theta_M\) from imaging does **not** match \(\arccos(v_s/v_d)\);  
3) No 13/26 spectral structure appears at threshold;  
4) No THz gain band is observed for \(v_d\gtrsim v_s\);  
5) No reproducible ~28 K feature is found;  
6) 13/12 rescaling fails to collapse cross-device thresholds.

---

## 8. Outlook Beyond Graphene

Because REST is geometric and material-agnostic, the same suite of signatures should appear in **bilayer graphene** (already observed), **Dirac/Weyl semimetals**, and **moiré** systems once cleanliness and geometry (nozzle-like constrictions, guided THz lines) are optimized. Near-term devices include **on-chip THz amplifiers**, **non-reciprocal mixers**, and **REST-locked oscillators**.

---

## Appendix A. Mathematical Notes (UFRF → Standard Forms)

**A1. REST balance**: \( \varepsilon_0 E^2 = \mu_0^{-1} B^2 \Rightarrow E=cB\).  
**A2. Minimum viscosity**: \( \eta/s = (1/4\pi)\sqrt{\varphi}\) (dimensionally consistent with \(\hbar/(k_B)\) units).  
**A3. Harmonic ladder**: \( f_n = n f_0/13,\; f_m = m f_0/26\) (Fourier quantization in a 13-phase periodic medium).  
**A4. Projection law**: \( \ln O=\ln O^*+d_M\alpha S+\varepsilon\) ⇒ simple multiplicative **13/12** rescaling for well-separated scales.
