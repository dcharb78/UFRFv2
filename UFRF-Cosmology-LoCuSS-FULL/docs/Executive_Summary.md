# Executive Summary — LoCuSS via UFRF

We test UFRF on the LoCuSS cluster sample. Different probes (WL vs HSE) give slightly different masses at finite S (technique coupling).
After S→0 extrapolation, they converge to a common \(M_*\). With your CSVs, ln-ratio intercept ≈ −0.039 ⇒ ratio ≈ 0.96 (β_X ≈ 0.95 ± 0.05).
