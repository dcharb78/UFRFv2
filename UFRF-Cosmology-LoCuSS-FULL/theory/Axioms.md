# UFRF Axioms (Cosmology)

1. **Projection Law** — Measurements are observer–observed projections: \(\ln O = \ln O_* + d_M\,\alpha\,S + \epsilon\).
2. **Single Latent Axis** — Per probe, a single axis S (learned from meta-features) dominates projection.
3. **Invariant** — \(O_*\) is the projection-free constant shared across techniques.
4. **Convergence** — After regressing S, independent probes converge to \(O_*\).
5. **Falsifiability** — If \(O_*\) does not converge across probes after S-regression, the hypothesis fails.
