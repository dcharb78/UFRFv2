# UFRF - Prime Gap Analysis Through Geometric Phase Space Framework

## Abstract

This repository contains an empirical investigation of prime number gap distributions using a geometric framework based on concurrent phase spaces. The analysis examines patterns in prime gaps up to 145 billion primes, revealing consistent structural patterns including phase-dependent gap distributions, evolving ratio relationships, and scale-dependent harmonic progressions.

## Theoretical Framework

### Core Principles

The analysis employs a framework where each prime p creates a logarithmic phase space (log_p space) that follows a 13-position cycle. Key assumptions:

1. **Phase Space Structure**: Each prime's phase space maps values to positions via logarithmic transformation
2. **13-Position Cycle**: Positions 0-12 represent a complete cycle, with position 0 designated as a "void" or source position
3. **Concurrent Operation**: All phase spaces operate simultaneously, creating interference patterns
4. **Scale Hierarchy**: Analysis conducted at scales M = 144 × 10^n for systematic comparison

### Mathematical Formulation

For a prime p and value v:
- Position in log_p space: `pos = log(v) / log(p)`
- Phase in 13-cycle: `phase = (pos × 13) mod 13`
- Gap analysis: Track occurrences of gaps g = p_(n+1) - p_n

## Methodology

### Data Generation
- Segmented sieve implementation for memory-efficient prime generation
- Scale checkpoints at M = {144, 1440, 14400, ..., 145×10^9}
- Gap counting and phase distribution analysis at each scale

### Metrics Tracked

1. **Gap Dominance Ratios**: Count(Gap_n) / Count(Gap_m) for various gap pairs
2. **Phase Distribution**: Occurrence count by phase (0-12) for each gap
3. **Projection Factors**: Observed density / theoretical density
4. **Interference Ratios**: Relationships between compound gaps and simple gaps

### Implementation

```python
# Core analysis structure
for each scale M:
    generate primes to M
    for each consecutive prime pair (p, p+n):
        gap = p+n - p
        phase = p mod 13
        record gap[phase] occurrence
    calculate ratios and patterns
```

## Empirical Results

### 1. Gap 6 / Gap 2 Ratio Evolution

| Scale | Primes | Gap 6 / Gap 2 |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 10M | 664,580 | 1.695 |
| 100M | 5,761,456 | 1.746 |
| 144M | 8,125,405 | 1.752 |
| 1B | 50,847,534 | 1.778 |
| 14.4B | 644,550,923 | 1.805 |
| 100B | 4,118,054,814 | 1.821 |

Pattern: Monotonic increase with scale.

### 2. Gap 26 Phase Distribution

Across all scales tested (up to 145B primes):
- Phase 0 occurrences: **0**
- Other phases: Approximately uniform distribution

This pattern holds without exception across ~10 million Gap 26 occurrences.

### 3. Gap 30 / Gap 10 Evolution

| Scale | Gap 30 / Gap 10 |
|-------|-----------------|
| 14.4K | 0.099 |
| 144K | 0.173 |
| 14.4M | 0.418 |
| 144M | 0.536 |
| 14.4B | 0.734 |
| 100B | 0.804 |

Pattern: Continuous evolution through multiple ratio regions.

### 4. Projection Factor (Gap 26)

Observed density / theoretical (2/13) density:

| Scale | Projection Factor |
|-------|------------------|
| 144K | 0.065 |
| 14.4M | 0.122 |
| 144M | 0.136 |
| 14.4B | 0.148 |
| 100B | 0.150 |

Pattern: Asymptotic approach toward ~0.143 (1/7).

## Pattern Analysis

### Scale-Dependent Behaviors

1. **Harmonic Progression**: Ratios evolve through recognizable fractional values
2. **Scale Boundaries**: M = 144 × 10^n scales show consistent transition points
3. **Ratio Stability**: Patterns stabilize at larger scales while maintaining evolution

### Phase-Dependent Structure

- Gap 26 shows absolute avoidance of phase 0 (13-cycle position 0)
- Other gaps show varying phase preferences
- Phase distribution becomes more uniform at larger scales for most gaps

### Concurrent Evolution

Different gap ratios evolve toward different limiting values:
- Gap 6/Gap 2: Increasing toward ~2.0
- Gap 30/Gap 10: Passed through 0.625 (5/8), continuing toward ~0.8
- Gap 42/Gap 14: Approaching 0.5
- Gap 78/Gap 26: Approaching ~0.185

## Discussion

The analysis reveals consistent patterns in prime gap distributions that persist across scales from thousands to billions of primes. Key observations:

1. **Structural Consistency**: Phase 0 avoidance for Gap 26 appears absolute
2. **Ratio Evolution**: Gap relationships evolve predictably through scale increases
3. **Scale Hierarchy**: M = 144 × 10^n boundaries show special properties
4. **Concurrent Patterns**: Multiple independent ratio evolutions occur simultaneously

These patterns suggest underlying geometric structure in prime distributions beyond standard probabilistic models. The framework provides a novel lens for examining prime gap behavior, though further mathematical analysis would be needed to establish whether these patterns arise from the fundamental properties of primes or from the specific analytical framework employed.

## Future Work
