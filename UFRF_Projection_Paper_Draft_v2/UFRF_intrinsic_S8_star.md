# Intrinsic S8* under UFRF Projection (Symmetric Normalization)

Assumption: projection factor ratio between cosmic and local probes is r = 13/12. 
Normalize so that geometric mean of projections equals 1 ⇒ P_c = √r, P_l = 1/√r.

Then:
- S8* from cosmic = S8_c / √r
- S8* from local = S8_l × √r

**Inverse-variance weighted S8***: **0.8003 ± 0.0083**

See the attached table for per-probe S8* contributions.
