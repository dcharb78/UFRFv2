# Repro Instructions

1. Open the CSVs in `/data` to inspect inputs.
2. Use the included notebooks (to be added) or re-run the Python snippets from our chat to:
   - Build all-pairs H0 ratios and histograms.
   - Compute cosmic/local S8 ratios.
   - Apply symmetric normalization to infer intrinsic H0* and S8*.
3. Export plots into `/figures` and confirm numbers against the JSON summaries.
