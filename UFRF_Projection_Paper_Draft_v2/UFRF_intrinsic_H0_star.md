# Intrinsic H0* under UFRF Projection (Symmetric Normalization)

Assumption: local/cosmic projection ratio r = 13/12, with normalization P_local = √r, P_cosmic = 1/√r.

Then:
- H0* from cosmic = H0_cosmic × √r
- H0* from local = H0_local ÷ √r

**Inverse-variance weighted H0***: **70.27 ± 0.34 km/s/Mpc**

See `ufrf_intrinsic_H0_star_table.csv` for per-probe contributions.
