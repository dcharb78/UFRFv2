# Abstract
The Hubble constant (H₀) and cosmic-web clumpiness (S₈) exhibit well-known tensions between early-universe and late-universe probes. We show that both tensions are quantitatively reconciled under the Unified Fractal Resonance Framework (UFRF) projection law, which predicts observer-relative projection ratios of approximately 13/12 between separated effective scales. Applying this factor with symmetric normalization yields consistent intrinsic values: H₀* ≈ 70.3 ± 0.3 km/s/Mpc and S₈* ≈ 0.800 ± 0.008. This framework provides a single, falsifiable geometric mechanism unifying multiple cosmological discrepancies without invoking probe-specific new physics.

# Introduction
Persistent tensions between early- and late-universe measurements, particularly of H₀ and S₈, have resisted explanation within ΛCDM extensions. UFRF proposes these tensions arise naturally from scale-projection effects, governed by the 13-position cycle ratio (13/12). Here we test this law using publicly available data and derive intrinsic cosmological parameters consistent across probes.

# Methods
- **Projection Law:** \( \ln O = \ln O^* + d_M\alpha S + \varepsilon \).  
- **Data:** Planck 2018, DESI 2025 BAO, SH0ES, JWST TRGB, TDCOSMO lenses, DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC-Y3.  
- **Analysis:** Compute all local/cosmic H₀ ratios and cosmic/local S₈ ratios. Apply symmetric normalization (P_c = √r, P_l = 1/√r with r=13/12) to infer intrinsic O*. Combine via inverse-variance weighting.

# Results
- **H₀:** Ratios cluster near 13/12, SH0ES/Planck nearly exact. Intrinsic H₀* = 70.27 ± 0.34 km/s/Mpc.  
- **S₈:** Cosmic/local ratios from DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC-Y3 cluster near 13/12 within 1σ. Intrinsic S₈* = 0.800 ± 0.008.  

# Pre-Registered Extension: Growth fσ₈(z)
We predict DESI DR2 redshift-binned RSD growth compared to WL tomographic amplitudes will show ratios near 13/12 at large scale separations and drift toward 1 where scales overlap. This test is falsifiable upon release of DR2 growth tables.

# Discussion
The projection law unifies H₀ and S₈ tensions via geometry, not new particle physics or dark energy models. It predicts systematic offsets across observables with consistent magnitude but sign depending on probe coupling. Limitations include small sample sizes and pending DR2 growth data.

# Conclusion
UFRF projection law resolves major cosmological tensions under one principle: ratios of 13/12 across scales. Intrinsic cosmological values are consistent across probes after deprojection. This provides a testable, reproducible path forward.
